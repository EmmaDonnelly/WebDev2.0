		You can actually put anything you like between the a tags. e.g. an image
		
		<p><a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="awesome.png"></a></p>
	
		Google is an absolute link, it goes to the same place.
		
		Relative links are used when you are linking to other pages on your website. As long as it is in the same folder it will link.
		
		<p><a href="helloworld.html">Click here</a></p>
		
		Anchor links are for linking within a page.
		e.g. a link at the bottom saying "back to top"
		
		Add an id in the paragraph tag at the top of the page so it knows where to anchor to, then:
		
		<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
