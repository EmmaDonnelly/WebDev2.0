		<h1>This is a big header! If you put your important keywords in here they are much more likely to appear in Google than normal text.</h1> 
		
		<h2>This is quite a big header.</h2>
		
		<h3>This isn't quite as big.</h3>
		
		<h4>This is even smaller.</h4>
		
		<h5>This is actually smaller than normal text.</h5>
		
		<h6>This is tiny and not really used.</h6>
		
		<h7>This doesn't exist, so it will show up as normal text</h7>
		
		This will also show up as normal text
		
		This will not create a break, it will just run on from above. To create separete lines we can use paragraph tags.
		
		<p>Like this</p>   
		
		<p>and this</p> 
		
		<p>Or we can use a line break like this <br> which is smaller than a full paragraph break.</p>
		
		The line break is a self closing tag. <br /> is a precise version used in xhtml.
