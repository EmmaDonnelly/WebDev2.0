<!--float right aligns it to the right of the page,
float left is on the left and also removes default 
margins so there's no gap between the divs.
Floating the second section left means it follows on 
from the previous one-->

		<h1>This is a heading</h1>
		
		<div id="first-section">

			<p>This is my first paragraph</p>
			<p>This is my second paragraph</p>
			<p>This is my third paragraph</p>

		<div id="second-section">

		<p>This fifth paragraph is not floated</p>
		
<!-- if you have a section floated left and a section 
floated right, anything unfloated will appear in the 
middle and folow the flow of the page. If you 
specifically want i underneath you can clear the floats
on a special div like so:-->		
		
		<div class="clear-float">
			<p>This is my sixth paragraph</p>
		</div>
