<!--check out web safe fonts and play around with them. You
should always have several in your fonr-family, so if the first
doesn't exist on the machine you have a back-up or two. This
is known as fallback-->

<!--You can pick a font from Google, which gives you more options
and these are hosted on their servers. They supply the link to the
external style sheet, and the name of the font-family.-->
